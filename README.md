# Python
The start of my python journey!

This repository is simply just a portfolio of python practice that I'm doing. I'm uploading all my practice files, scripts, programs, 
whatever it is that I decide to make involving Python. Python is essential to my career not only in development, but also especially in
security. I understand how important it is to have this language down as it is very helpful in automation and even in creating malware
in pentesting to exploit vulnerabilities.
